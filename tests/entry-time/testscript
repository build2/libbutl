# Filesystem entry times resolution may vary across OSes and underlying APIs,
# so the timestamp set for the entry may differ a bit from the one we get for
# it afterwards. On most of the platforms we are testing on the resolution is
# at least a millisecond. MacOS has a second resolution on HFS+ file system.
#
# Some time point since epoch, expressed in milliseconds.
