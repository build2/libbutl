# This library was modularized using the Modules TS semantics (with support
# for dual, module/header consumption) which was subsequently partially
# dismantled. We, however, kept some of the changes in anticipation that they
# would be useful when attempting to modularize using the merged modules
# semantics. Specifically, there are currently headers with both .mxx and .hxx
# extensions and the code is littered with the `#if __cpp_[lib_]modules_ts`
# blocks. Note that it's important for the auto-generated header support
# that the default extension for hxx{} is .hxx.
#
# @@ If/when going back to using mxx{}, make sure to cleanup explicit .mxx.
